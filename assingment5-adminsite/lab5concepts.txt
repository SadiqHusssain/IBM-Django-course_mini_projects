Concepts covered in this mini project:

Django admin site: A built-in feature of the Django web framework that serves as an interface and allows authorized users to perform various management operations on the data stored in the application’s database.

Superuser: A user account with administrative privileges that allows superusers to perform administrative tasks and manage the application’s data.

Admin class: A class that helps fine-tune the behavior, appearance, and functionality of models within the Django admin site.

Inline class: Allow you to include related model instances in the same page/form as the parent model, instead of switching between different forms or screens.
